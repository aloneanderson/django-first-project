<p>
    Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. The story takes place
    in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe. Players assume the first-person perspective of a
    customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged
    combat.

    The game was developed using the REDengine 4 by a team of around 500 people, exceeding the number that worked on the
    studio's previous game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015). CD Projekt launched a new division in Wrocław, Poland, and
    partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike
    Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. The original score was led by Marcin
    Przybyłowicz, featuring the contributions of several licensed artists.

    CD Projekt released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 10 December 2020, with
    PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions planned to follow in 2021. It received praise for its narrative, setting,
    and graphics, although some of its gameplay elements received mixed responses. In contrast, it was widely criticized
    for bugs, particularly in the console versions which also suffered from performance issues; Sony removed it from the
    PlayStation Store on 17 December 2020.
